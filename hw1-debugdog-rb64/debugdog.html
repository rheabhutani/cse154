          Many a programmer has heard of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber Duck Debugging</a>.
          But they do not know the power of a Debug Dog. Particularly Mowgli the Debug Dog.

        As Douglas Adams once said, "One is never alone with a rubber duck." Mowgli
        the Debug Dog is far from a patient listener, but still will help you solve
        your debugging woes. Unlike a rubber duck, Mowgli is cuddly and goofy, doubling
        as your entertainment for the occasional times you need a break from your
        work (use with caution).

                I remember the first time I met Mowgli. He looked so goofy as he stared at the
                code with me. I slowly explained everything and he sort of listened to my every
                word. The pauses were uncomfortable, but then I SAW it. I saw the error. Mowgli
                saved me hours of anguish!

          While it may seem strange, programmers use rubber ducks to make
          their work a little bit easier. Even though the ducks don’t really
          do anything on their own, it turns out just explaining the code
          to them can help a programmer find the problem.
        </p>
        <p class="creative-para">
          Mowgli the Debug Dog works the same way. Just snuggle up next to him
          and explain your entire code line by line, and he will definitely
          catch any mistakes you may have in your code!
        </p>
        <p class="creative-para">
          Reasons Mowgli should be used to debug code:
        </p>
        <ul id="creative-ul">
          <li>Will keep you entertained while you debug</li>
          <li>Better than your average rubber duck:
            <ul>
              <li>Certainly cuter</li>
              <li>Will keep you warm</li>
